  abstract   = {Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) is an instruction set and an execution environment inside the Linux kernel. It enables modification, interaction, and kernel programmability at runtime. eBPF can be used to program the eXpress Data Path (XDP), a kernel network layer that processes packets closer to the NIC for fast packet processing. Developers can write programs in C or P4 languages and then compile to eBPF instructions, which can be processed by the kernel or by programmable devices (e.g., SmartNICs). Since its introduction in 2014, eBPF has been rapidly adopted by major companies such as Facebook, Cloudflare, and Netronome. Use cases include network monitoring, network traffic manipulation, load balancing, and system profiling. This work aims to present eBPF to an inexpert audience, covering the main theoretical and fundamental aspects of eBPF and XDP, as well as introducing the reader to simple examples to give insight into the general operation and use of both technologies.},

  abstract  = {We compared UDP and TCP traffic in several traffic traces collected from different networks and geographical locations, at different times. We find that TCP still dominates in terms of packets and bytes, but UDP is now often responsible for the largest fraction of flows on a given link. A port-based analysis suggests that the recent increase in UDP flows on the traces analyzed stems mainly from P2P applications using UDP for their overlay signaling traffic. This trend may again change with the advent of IPTV and UDP based P2P applications, which not only signal, but also transport large data segments via UDP. We will continue to monitor available data to track trends in UDP usage, and specifically seek data from China where UDP-based IPTV traffic is already common. Finally, we note that precise traffic classification requires methods beyond simple port classification. Most current traffic classification techniques focus on TCP, with only preliminary examination of techniques for UDP traffic (other than deep packet inspection). Given the growing evidence for the use of UDP for increasingly popular applications, including for bulk data transfer in China, we conclude that traffic analysis methods must evolve to classify also UDP traffic.},

                                genuine services running some application protocols built over UDP to
                                generate amplified traffic targeting victim network. An Internet Service
                                Provider (ISP) may host hundreds or even thousands of hosts running
                                these vulnerable protocols that could become amplifier nodes in DRDoS
                                attacks. If abused, they can collectively cause large volumes of garbage
                                amplification traffic flowing out of the ISP network. This wasteful
                                bandwidth consumption costs the provider money and loss of Quality of
                                Service (QoS) to its customers. Moreover, the owners of services
                                vulnerable to amplification have to spend their resources to process
                                illicit requests.
                                In this paper, we propose a novel idea to filter out garbage traffic
                                from an ISP network. We employ a special type of a honeypot that
                                collects information about ongoing DRDoS attacks, and Software Defined
                                Network (SDN) paradigm offering us a unified interface to deploy
                                firewall rules on a large variety of network devices. The rules block
                                incoming amplification requests from reaching amplifiers located within
                                the provider network rescuing vulnerable services from being abused.
                                This prevents garbage traffic from leaving the network enabling the
                                provider to save money and improve QoS. Moreover, our solution also
                                contributes to victim's liveliness because it reduces the attack traffic
                                reaching the target network. In addition, it stimulates ISPs to
                                implement ingress filtering best practices for all its network routers
                                in order to minimize damage from an attacker located in the same

  abstract  = {Software Defined Network (SDN) is a network architecture which is used to improve the control and flexibility of the network. It separates the control plane which is used to manage the network and the data plane in which the data flows. In recent scenarios SDN is majorly used in cloud computing environments, enterprise data centers, etc. because it offers flexible, dynamic, and programmable functionality of network systems. This paper provides an implementation, analysis, and evaluation of the QoS Parameters of SDN traffic produced from host to the target based on the TCP and UDP flow. Open flow is used as a communication protocol because in this system becomes more natural, agile, and flexible to adopt changes. We have considered the packet level arrival of the TCP and UDP packets. The controllers have been run in a centralized manner and the performance measuring parameters like throughput, jitter, packet loss, and delay have been evaluated for both TCP and UDP. Mininet is used as an emulator to build the infrastructure and DIT-G is used as a traffic generator tool.},
